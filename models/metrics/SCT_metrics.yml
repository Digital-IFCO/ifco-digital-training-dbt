# Now we create metrics that use the measures previously defined.
# Witht hese metrics we can do dynamic queries using MetricFlow with the assistance
# of entities and dimensions.

# These same queries done in MetricFlow can be saved to saved_queries. 
# Check SCT_saved_queries.yml to check both the MetricFlow command and the equivalent saved_query.

metrics:
  # What are the top 10 transactions to unknown locations Within a given time period?
  - name: number_of_transactions
    description: The number of transactions

    label: count of transactions
