#### Installing the project dependencies

We use Poetry to manage code dependencies and virtual environments. So the first thing you should do is installing Poetry. 
Be sure to execute the following command using the python environment installed by pyenv. To do this, close the terminal 
and open it again and run `python --version` to see that you are using python version 3.11.10  ðŸ‘‡
    
    pip install poetry

Install the dependencies ðŸ‘‡

    poetry install
