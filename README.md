# DBT Training

Welcome to the DBT Training Repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is your hands-on guide to mastering DBT (Data Build Tool) for building scalable and maintainable data pipelines. Whether youâ€™re new to DBT or looking to deepen your understanding, this training is focused on teaching you how to use DBT effectively to transform and model data.

Through this training, youâ€™ll learn how to:
 - Build and manage DBT models for modular, testable SQL.
 - Apply best practices for organizing and structuring DBT projects.
 - Leverage DBT features like tests, macros, and incremental models.
 - Debug and optimize transformations using DBT commands and logs.
 - Collaborate effectively by version-controlling your DBT project.

The included setup instructions are a quick start to ensure your development environment is ready for DBT workflows. Once set up, the training will dive straight into real-world use cases and examples.

Letâ€™s get started and take your data transformation skills to the next level! ðŸš€
